### 📜 Problem Description

You are given the  `head`  of a linked list with  `n`  nodes.

For each node in the list, find the value of the  **next greater node** . That is, for each node, find the value of the first node that is next to it and has a  **strictly larger**  value than it.

Return an integer array  `answer`  where  `answer[i]`  is the value of the next greater node of the  `ith`  node ( **1-indexed** ). If the  `ith`  node does not have a next greater node, set  `answer[i] = 0` .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/05/linkedlistnext2.jpg) 

```
Input: head = [2,7,4,3,5]
Output: [7,0,5,5,0]

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the list is  `n` .
	
- `1 <= n <= 104`
	
- `1 <= Node.val <= 109`
